#Original Data Set Variables & Descriptions

Variables:

-Subject (10,299 Observations,1 Variable)

-Activity (10,299 Observations, 1 Variable)

-Features (10,299 Observations, 561 Variables)

Descriptions:

Subject:A group of 30 volunteers between the ages of 19-48 who performed the activity. Observations split into test and training data sets

Activity: The activity type performed by the Subject. There are six acitivities performed: 1) Walking,2)Walking_Upstairs, 3) Walking_Downstairs, 4) Sitting, 5) Standing, 6) Laying. Observations split into test and training data sets.

Features:

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz are captured. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAccelerometer a-XYZ and timeGyroscope-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyacceleration-XYZ and timeGravityAcceleration-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ and timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelerationMagnitude, timeGravityAccelerationMagnitude, timeBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcceleration-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ, frequencyBodyGyro-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroJerkMagnitude.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:


timeBodyAccelerometer-XYZ
timeGravityAccelerometer-XYZ
timeBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ
timeBodyGyroscope-XYZ
timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-XYZ
timeBodyAccelerometerMagnitude
timeGravityAccelerometerMagnitude
timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude
timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude
timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude
frequencyBodyAccelerometer-XYZ
frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ
frequencyBodyGyroscope-XYZ
frequencyBodyAccelerometerMagnitude
frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude
frequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitude
frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals total 561 observations, including:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
max(): Maximum Value
min(): Minimum Value
correlation(): Correlation


# Transformation of original dataset

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set (10,299 Observations,563 Variables)
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement(10,299 Observations,68 Variables).
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (180 Observations, 68 Variables).
